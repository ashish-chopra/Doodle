Doodle
======
A no sense way of visualizing "something" of a data structure. 

Doodle is a RESTful web based application to see visual profiles of a data structure.
Once upon a time i was itching to do something funny and creative with somewhat boring and serious data structures i was coding; so is Doodle.

Why We call it Doodle?
=======================
According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doodle) - A doodle is an unfocused or unconscious drawing made while a person's attention is otherwise 
occupied. Doodles are simple drawings that can have concrete representational meaning or may just be abstract shapes.

This reason was enough to call it _Doodle_ because when this project was conceived, i was not clear about what am i gonna 
show??? So i came with an abstract concept called "Doodle Charts".

Development
==============
Doodle is currently under development. Please find more information on [Wiki](https://github.com/ashish-chopra/Doodle/wiki).
An active roadmap is also published on wiki along with some other worth reading reports and articles giving more insight into 
Doodle.

How to get it?
===================
Well, it's pretty straight-forward. 

Just clone the repo or download it as it is.  
Import it into Eclipse and start exploring!  
Running the code is as simple as downloading but don't forget to read next section before running.  
Just run the ` build.xml ` in eclipse and it is deployed in your web-server.  
Turn-on your server & fire the URL in browser to see it in ACTION!!!  

What do I need?
==================
So to run it you need 
   1. Tomcat 6.0 (at ` C:\tomcat ` - as i used in compilation scripts)
   2. Google Chrome (To see ` HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript ` in action)
